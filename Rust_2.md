#### 10.2 Traits: Defining Shared Behavior

##### What is Trait for?

A trait defines the functionality a particular type has and can share with other types. We can use traits to define shared behavior in an abstract way. We can use trait bounds to specify that a generic type can be any type that has certain behavior.

##### What determines the behavior of a type?

The behavior of a type is defined by the set of methods we can call on that type.

##### When types shares the same behavior?

 Different types share the same behavior if we can call the same methods on all of those types.

#####  Hwo in Rust define a shared behavior?

Trait definitions are a way to group method signatures together to define a set of behaviors necessary to accomplish some purpose.

##### How define Trait?

We declare a trait using the trait keyword and then the trait’s name. We also must declare a trait as pub so that crates depending on this crate can make use of this trait too. Inside the curly brackets, we declare the method signatures that describe the behaviors of the types that implement this trait. After the method signature, instead of providing an implementation within curly brackets, we use a semicolon. 

```rust
// Filename: src/lib.rs
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String;
}
```

##### How a type implements a trait?

Each type implementing a trait must provide its own custom behavior for the body of a trait methods. The compiler will enforce that any type that has a trait will have methods defined its  signatures exactly.

After `impl`, we put the trait name we want to implement, then use the `for` keyword, and then specify the name of the type we want to implement the trait for. Within the impl block, we put the method signatures that the trait definition has defined. Instead of adding a semicolon after each signature, we use curly brackets and fill in the method body with the specific behavior that we want the methods of the trait to have for the particular type.

```rust
// Filename: src/lib.rs

pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String;
}

pub struct NewsArticle {
    pub headline: String,
    pub location: String,
    pub author: String,
    pub content: String,
}

impl Summary for NewsArticle {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("{}, by {} ({})", self.headline, self.author, self.location)
    }
}

pub struct Tweet {
    pub username: String,
    pub content: String,
    pub reply: bool,
    pub retweet: bool,
}

impl Summary for Tweet {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("{}: {}", self.username, self.content)
    }
}
```

##### How should we use a types that implement a trait?

When a type implement a trait we can call trait method on an instance of the type in the same way we call regular methods. The only difference is that the user must bring the trait into scope as well as the types

```rust
use aggregator::{Summary, Tweet};

fn main() {
    let tweet = Tweet {
        username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
        content: String::from(
            "of course, as you probably already know, people",
        ),
        reply: false,
        retweet: false,
    };

    println!("1 new tweet: {}", tweet.summarize());
}
```

##### Can we implement external traits on external types?

we can’t implement external traits on external types. For example, we can’t implement the Display trait on Vec<T> within our aggregator crate because Display and Vec<T> are both defined in the standard library and aren’t local to our aggregator crate.

we can implement a trait on a type only if either the trait or the type, or both, are local to our crate.

##### Can a trait contain an implementation of the method it defines?

A trait can contain method whit implementation. This is called "Default Implementations"

```rust
// Filename: src/lib.rs
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        String::from("(Read more...)")
    }
}
```

##### What happen if a type implement trait whit default implemented methods

We can call a methods of the trait on type instance. In case the type make own implementations this methods (this called 'overriding') - will be called this methods, otherwise will be called default implemented  methods  of the trait.

```rust
impl Summary for NewsArticle {} //will be called trait methods

let article = NewsArticle {
    headline: String::from("Penguins win the Stanley Cup Championship!"),
    location: String::from("Pittsburgh, PA, USA"),
    author: String::from("Iceburgh"),
    content: String::from(
        "The Pittsburgh Penguins once again are the best \
            hockey team in the NHL.",
    ),
};

println!("New article available! {}", article.summarize());
```

##### Can default implemented trait methods call other methods of the trait?

Default implementations can call other methods in the same trait, even if those other methods don’t have a default implementation. In this way, a trait can provide a lot of useful functionality and only require implementors to specify a small part of it.

```rust
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize_author(&self) -> String;

    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("(Read more from {}...)", self.summarize_author())
    }
}

// To use this version of Summary, we only need to define summarize_author when we implement the trait on a type:

impl Summary for Tweet {
    fn summarize_author(&self) -> String {
        format!("@{}", self.username)
    }
}

let tweet = Tweet {
    username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
    content: String::from(
        "of course, as you probably already know, people",
    ),
    reply: false,
    retweet: false,
};

println!("1 new tweet: {}", tweet.summarize());
```

##### How to call the default implementation from an overriding implementation of that same method?

it isn’t possible

##### How to use traits to define functions that accept many different types?

We will be able to pass to that function any type that implement thats trait.

```rust
pub fn notify(item: &impl Summary) {
    println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
}
```
